# Ace-of-the-Grid
<strong>\[The code in this repository is that of the title menu and colour selection menu, along with the basic skeleton for the board\]</strong><br>
Nascent idea for a custom board game, designed in JAVA.<br>
Built off of chain reaction, this custom version of chain reaction adds in new elements called "Aces".<br>
In addition to the normal rules of chain reaction, Aces add a new sort of interaction to the board- there are 4 kinds of aces, each of them adds a<br>
little something to the board's interaction scheme, if it is involved in a reaction:<br>
(<strong>Activation</strong> here, refers to a Ace being involved in a chain reaction).<br>
Ace of Flames:<br>

<br>
A destructive ace, destroys adjacent cells if it is activated.<br>
Ace of Frost:<br>

<br>

<br>
This Ace switches the colour of the reaction to the next player's colour.<br>
Ace of Rage:<br>

<br>
Constructive Ace, doubles the number of cells which come out of a explosive reaction.<br>
The specefic implementations are still being worked on, and this project is heavy is development.<br>
